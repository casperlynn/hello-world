1.)
I implement elements of computational thinking in my everyday life by one, thinking logically. I assume most of us can think logically in our everyday life. But for examples, at my job, I would want to logically put in what a customer has ordered through our POS system so it can properally get rang in. It wouldn't make sense for me to ring in a different drink or food item than what someone ordered. 
I also use abstraciton daily as well. I think the easiest example to give would be playing video games. I know my basic controls of how to move around, how to fight, how to navigate the menu, etc. But, I myself do not know how those things are actually working behind the scenes in the games code because I don't need to fully understand the operations and coding of the game to play a video game.
For utilizing decomposition in every day tasks, an example would doing homework. Sometimes if the homework is a lot or you're confused, it's best to break it down first. Like the top-down design, it would be easier to look at the main parts of the homework then slowly anazlyse those specific portions to complete your work.

Computational thinking used in everyday life is not very different from computational thinking in the academic environment. You're essentially using the same meth
