Excercise 1:
Part 1.) There could be hundreds of different surroundings for Picobot to encounter.
It would depend on what was in the room like furniture, trash or other objects.
Picobot could encounter these objects multiple times as well from different sides.
It would also depend if there were half walls or anything of the sort as well.
With it's internal states, it's possible it has 100 internal states.
There can be more data that it posseses which helps it navigates with its order combo's of NEWSX.
These different directional combos have 16 different combos it could utilize, which gives room for other data.
Part 2.) In the lower left corner, Picobot can travel North all the way to the end of the room.
It can turn and move one block to the east, then proceed to go back down in a line towards the South.
Then it can go one block to the east again, then proceed to head back up North to the end.
It can repeat these lined directions until it reaches the last block.

Excercise 2:
Part 1.)I don't believe it will change the number of different surroundings if it's still in the same sized room.
We can't reuse the exact plan from exercice 1, but the idea of it snaking around can still work.
Part 2.) Depending on where it could start, Picobot can travel in an open direction that will lead to an end wall. 
It should travel alongside all of the walls first. Then it can travel in the oposite directon alongside the path again.
It can repeat these actions sort of in a wonky spiral, following alongside the paths, until it gets to the lack empty area that it needs to reach.
